# Data-Analysis-Practice-Case
Hello everyone. I'll show u here my practice case of data analysis make it on the course of "data analysis by Google". I'm so proud of all i learned in this course, so enjoy it.

I first perform the analysis in Excel using the spreadsheet named "202201-divvy-tripdata", (i can't upload the Excel file because is quite large in terms of MB, but i'll show an image of spreadsheet), applying the analysis techniques I learned in the course. I use various Excel functions and create pivot tables to extract useful data for this case. Later, I utilize the R language for the analysis of all the spreadsheets, which allows for faster and more accurate data processing.
